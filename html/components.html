                <p> While Unity is an amazing gamedev platform, getting used to it will require a bit of initial work, as you'll likely need to shift your cognitive cogs to grasp its component-based architecture. While classic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) can be, and is, used, the Unity workflow highly builds around the structure of components-which requires component-based thinking.</p>

                <p> The game view actually shows how the game will show during run time. The game you are creating is fully playable and observable in the game view. That means you can quickly test your changes just by pressing the Play button.</p>
